    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">I feel like this class allowed me to use my resources to create something that is both visually interesting and functional, as I am very much a logical and non-abstract person. I definitely can improve on my non-linear thinking when it comes to visual presentation, however, as I personally feel like my projects were not as well-developed, intentional, or planned as other students were.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">I really valued the feedback of the other students in class and seeing what they had created. It allowed me to reflect on what I would change or what I misunderstood about an assignment and challenged me to think outside of my comfort zone. I also helped a fellow classmate navigate VSCode and HTML/CSS. </p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">I have gained an understanding of consistency and making projects thatare unique to me rather than the template doing all the talking. I do need to dedicate more time to presenting my ideas in a visually interesting or fun way while making it look nice. Stepping out of my comfort zone is difficult.</p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">For the examining bias page, I did a small amount of research on the subject of bias, however, I feel as though I researched how to use HTML and CSS more to find new and interesting things I could add to my page and everything look and appear the way I intended it to. As someone who has never used HTML before, I think I have gotten better at using it and appreciate its simplicity.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Though I haven't necessarily presented in class much, I do like the ability to show others in class what I have been working on and what I have learned to do. I also enjoy presenting when I am proud of my work, so I do want to work harder to make even more impressive projects so that I can present them and feel accomplished.</p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I was always trying to find ways that I could encorporate what I learned into something related to my end goal project and find a new angle to come at it from. My talk with Dr. Keown also really allowed me to think in a more educational, productive angle when it comes to the feminist movement. </p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Everyone's notes on my creations were very helpful, and at times I feel like others created things that were better than what I made, though all of us had very different goals and my original plan for my research project fell through due to the interview and the B-roll not being as interesting. </p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">These projects I feel like I could truly make my mark on, in particular the B-roll making and the interview making. Those were both things I felt a huge connection to and took the most time to think through and plan. The in-class activities I did not feel as drawn to, mainly because they were quick and did not require a lot of thought. I wish I had done more with them.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">The B-Roll and interview makings caused me to look outward on the internet for topics of discussion, as well as moments in pop culture that may exemplify the design I envision for my overall project.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I did not present my work much in this section due to many of our projects being done in class, though the photo essay was pretty easy for me to explain my classmates. I felt very comfortable talking to them and receiving their feedback.</p>

        <p>Using this slide deck, I pitched my idea for my kiosk project and presented my research to my fellow classmates and instructor. I wanted to gather more information on the female experience, how it relates to men and people of color, and what pieces of media further the concept of feminism or girlhood.</p>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">My research and the flexibility of the kiosk project allowed me to make exactly what I wanted and convey the plan I had thought of almost to a T. When something in my code didn't work, I was forced to think outside of the box or change my design to allow for a similar method, which occurred when I was sutrggling to get the modal to work with all seven of my buttons. I switched to a format where the box at the bottom changed and I am very happy with it.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I was very impressed with everyone's projects and it was a lovely experience to hear feedback for what I made and the concepts I was conveying to my user with my research. The notes I received were thoughtful and let me see my project from other perspectives that I wouldn't have thought of. </p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I wanted to make a personal experience for my user and connect them not only to the material that I researched, but also to myself. My vision for the kiosk wasn't neccesarily new, but I feel like I put an original, trendy and charming spin on the traditional room exploration kiosk. I wish I had been able to make it more accessible, but I still feel like I made something authentic to me. </p>

  <div class="col-sm-2">
     </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Obviously I used the internet, scholarly texts, and many media companies' analysis of pop culture, society, and the economy and their relation to girlhood and feminism. However, I also researched how to accomplish certain parts of the kiosk that I wanted to integrate in my code, such as the buttons across the picture. I also looked into different methods that museum kiosks use to convey their information to users to get inspired about what I wanted my own kiosk to look like.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I felt very confident when I explained my plan and research to the class, as feminism is a topic I am extremely passionate about and the kiosk was a project I was excited to create! This class has allowed me to feel more secure when speaking about the works I have taken the time to make, as well as develop and displayt what I find to be interesting, entertaining, and important. </p>
